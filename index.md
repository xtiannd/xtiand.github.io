## Professional Statement

My name is Christian. I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented technical support and cybersecurity professional with a passion for protecting sensitive data and mitigating cyber threats while providing top tier customer support. I am committed to safeguarding company data and maintaining the integrity of digital infrastructures in a forward-thinking organization. I am passionate about staying ahead of the curve in the evolving landscape of cyber threats. I am very eager to bring my knowledge of encryption algorithms and intrusion detection systems to a dynamic cybersecurity team.


# Security Audit for Botium Toys

Conducted a security audit by implementing the NIST CSF, establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. Implemented PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC type 1, and SOC type 2 compliances

# NIST Cybersecurity Framework 

Used the NIST CSF to respond to a DDoS attack through a flood of incoming ICMP packets. Implemented a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets and an IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

# Linux Commands

Used Linux commands to changed multiple permissions to match the level of authorization the organization wanted for files and directories in the projects directory. The first step in this was using ls -la to check the permissions for the directory. This informed my decisions in the following steps. I then used the chmod command multiple times to change the permissions on files and directories.

# SQL

Applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.

# Vulnerable Assessment

Analyzed a vulnerable system for a small business and used NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 to guide the risk analysis of the information system, proposed a remediation strategy such as Principle of least privilege, Defense in depth, MFA, AAA framework.

# Incident Documentation 

Documented incidents with an incident handler's journal: Documented a ransomware incident, analyzed a packet capture file using WireShark, used tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic, Used VirusTotal to investigate a suspicious file hash.

# PASTA Threat Model Framework

Applied the PASTA threat model framework to launch a sneaker shopping app: Compliance with PCI-DSS, Defined technologies used by the app (API, PKI, SHA-256, SQL), Used data flow diagram to decompose the app, Threat Analysis (Injection and Session hijacking), Vulnerability Analysis (Lack of prepared statements, Broken API token), Used Attack Tree Diagram for Attack Modeling, Risk Analysis and Impact (SHA-256, Incident Response Procedures, Password Policy, Principle of Least Privilege).
