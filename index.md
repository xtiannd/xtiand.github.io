# Used the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident

Used the NIST CSF to respond to a DDoS attack through a flood of incoming ICMP packets. Implemented a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets and an IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.
